After taking a course which had mandatory lectures that lasted for 20 minutes instead of the scheduled two hours, a lecturer who barely spoke English and very poor communication from the course personnel I started going through the course feedback in the university's systems. On the scale of zero to five students had given this course a 3. As a matter of fact about 94% of courses seemed to have a grade between 3 and 4.5. I reinvented the scale. Frontend coded with react, data scraping done with Selenium."
