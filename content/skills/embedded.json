      "description": "I have not listed many school projects here because every university graduate has done those same things. However, this is one succeeded exceptionally well. The assignment was to design a product from a bunch of LEDs controlled by a microcontroller. I came up with the idea of a quick-read code (2-dimensional barcode) This particular code changes every few milliseconds. Modern smartphone cameras capture up to 960 frames per second. Hence the name: 2 spatial dimensions and the fourth (temporal) dimension."
