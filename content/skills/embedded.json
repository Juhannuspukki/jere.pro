      "I have not listed many school projects here because in the end everyone has to complete them. However, this is one succeeded exceptionally well. The assignment was to design a product from a bunch of LEDs controlled by a microcontroller. I came up with the idea of a quick-read code (2-dimensional barcode) This particular code changes every few milliseconds. Modern smartphone cameras capture up to 960 frames per second. Hence the name: 2 spatial dimensions and the fourth (temporal) dimension."

      "I used a Teensy 3.2 board (almost like an Arduino, but not quite) to make a device that uses FFT to analyze music. The resulting information is then used to control a RGB LED in real time. Yeah, I know the video doesn't look like much without the audio track. Sorry."
