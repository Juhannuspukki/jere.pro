Due to the lack of UI designers, I also designed the site myself. All of us were very pleased with the result. As a bonus, I installed Netlify CMS to allow non-coders to update the site as well."

On the scale of zero to five students had given this course a 3. As a matter of fact about 94% of courses seemed to have a grade between 3 and 4.5. I reinvented the scale. Frontend coded with react, data scraping done with Selenium."
