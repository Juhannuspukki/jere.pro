During the Covid lockdown of Bangkok in 2020 I had nothing to do, so I decided to ace the
Kasetsart University game development course. I decided to re-create one of
those Flash-based games I used to play as a kid and came up with this Unity
version. The process involved drawing all the sprites for the game and a matching UI.
