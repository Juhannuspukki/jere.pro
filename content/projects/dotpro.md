Back in 2017 I decided that I need a website of my own. It took a year to decide what sort of
site to make and what technologies to use, but finally I decided to try
Next.js (at the time version was 6.1.1) which seemed an ultra-modern and interesting choice at the
time. The result is the very fast hybrid application you see before you. Behold! In retrospect the
choice of framework might not have been that successful: due to breaking changes in Next.js every few months
the site needs to be rewritten so often that it is a significant contributor to my JavaScript fatigue.
But hey, at least I learned a new framework.
