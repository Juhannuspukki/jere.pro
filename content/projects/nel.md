Neuro Event Labs is a Finnish company developing a video monitoring system for
epilepsy patients. During my time with them, one of my main duties was taking
care of the company's public website. I have now made three different versions
of the website. The latest revision was also one of my first projects using
Sass instead of plain CSS.
