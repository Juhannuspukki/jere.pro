Logos was my first software project. After learning Python for the very first
time I figured that I had to do something to not forget how to use it. I
started the development of a bot. During all these years I have added several
features to the bot, such as wayfinding services, nysse-locator services, a
minesweeper game, information about the school's menus, weather forecasts and
so on and so forth.
