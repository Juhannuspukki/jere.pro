A web app for calculating various things for a game called Eve: Echoes. The
app's backend refreshes every 24 hours to retrieve new pricing data from an external
API. It also generates a new access token and sends it to FTL Industries' (a
game guild) Discord server. This solution prevents unauthorized access while
it still remains possible to share the service with corporation (guild)
members who do not have a Discord account.
