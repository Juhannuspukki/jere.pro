29th of October, 2018. After taking a course which had mandatory lectures that
lasted for 20 minutes instead of the scheduled two hours, a lecturer who
barely spoke English and very poor communication from the course personnel I
started going through the course feedback in the university's systems. On the
scale of zero to five students had given this course a 3. As a matter of fact
about 94% of courses seemed to have a grade between 3 and 4.5. I reinvented
the scale. Frontend coded with React, data scraping done with Selenium.
