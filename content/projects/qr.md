I have not listed many school projects here because every university
graduate has done those same things. However, this is one succeeded exceptionally
well. The assignment was to design a product from a bunch of LEDs controlled by
a microcontroller. I came up with the idea of a quick-read code (2-dimensional barcode)
This particular code changes every few milliseconds. Modern smartphone cameras capture
up to 960 frames per second. Hence the name: 2 spatial dimensions and the fourth
(temporal) dimension.
