I was a member of the debate society for three years. Eventually, there were talks
about making a new website. The debate society had previously had at least
three, all of which had been abandoned due to lack of maintenance. Therefore I created
a static site designed to outlive the society itself. I also designed the site myself. All of us were
very pleased with the result. As a bonus, I installed Netlify CMS to allow
non-coders to update the site as well.
