I served on the board of Tampereen teekkarien avaruusteknillinen kerho Castor
ry in 2019. During that time, it was my duty to create a new website for the
club. It is a static site based on the Netlify victor-hugo project and for a time it also
featured the Netlify CMS to allow easy content editing.
