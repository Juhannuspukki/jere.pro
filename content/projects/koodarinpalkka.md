In early 2019 Sysart contacted me. They wanted to increase their salary transparency, and
I designed and implemented a React application that shows anyone interested what they would earn
at Sysart. This calculator was later featured in [Ilta-Sanomat](https://www.is.fi/taloussanomat/art-2000006398206.html)
and was nominated as the recruitment deed of the year. Try it!
